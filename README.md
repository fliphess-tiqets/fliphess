### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As using a single one-purpose github account for work and private was causing too much input in the wrong timeframes, I decided to split up my account into multiple:

- My fliphess account (this one), that will only be held for historic purposes, but which I don't frequently use anymore.
- My @summerflip account which I will use for home automation and other private, non-work-related projects.
- Work accounts on which I will receive the whole shebang of linux, security, kubernetes and other work-related notifications and all the like.

This is so I don't get work related notifications on my private github account when coding and searching github as a way to relax.
