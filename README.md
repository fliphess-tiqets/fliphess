# Creating complex solutions for simple problems since 2001! 

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As using a single one-purpose github account for work and private was causing too much input in the wrong timeframes, I decided to split up my account into multiple:

- My [fliphess](https://github.com/fliphess) account (this one), account which I will use for hobby stuff where the sun is always shining: home automation and other private, non-work-related projects.
- Work accounts on which I will receive the whole shebang of linux, security, kubernetes and other work-related notifications and all the like.

This is so I don't get all the work related notifications on my private github account when coding and searching github as a way to relax during weekends.

Most of my recemt projects can be found in the [flapperdeflipper](https://github.com/flapperdeflipper) organization.
